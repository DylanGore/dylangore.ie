This is a device I designed that used the OBD-II port in a vehicle to gather information like speed and engine RPM. The GPS location is also got from the user's mobile device via the Blynk app.

All of the data is gathered and sent to Firebase (using Adafruit IO as an intermediary for security and data aggregation) where it is stored and where the Vue JS web app is hosted to display the data to the user.

More information and screenshots of the device and web app in action can be found using the GitHub repository linked below.
